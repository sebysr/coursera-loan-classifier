# Coursera-Loan-Classifier

In this project, I will complete a notebook to build a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not.

I'm going to use a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. I'm going to use the following algorithms to build the models:

- K-Nearest Neighbour
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine
- Logistic Regression

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:
- Jaccard index
- F1-score
- LogLoass
